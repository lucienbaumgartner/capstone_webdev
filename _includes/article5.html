            <p>There are several aspects of policing that need to change in order to ease this tense situation. For one, experts agree that the accountability process of police officers has to be reformed further. “Our accountability issues with the police are a cancer we urgently need to deal with”, says Hassan Abdille. For him, accountability processes are especially weak for ethnic-related reasons as well as corruption. “Sometimes we fail to hold the police accountable because  of corruption and impunity in the system and because we value ethnicity more than the issues of torture, extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances within the police. And people are protected because of their ethnic backgrounds”, he says.</p>

            <p>According to Ramadhan Rajab, when it comes to policing, not only the functionality of the IPOA but also the one of the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Internal Affairs Unit (IAU) is a Unit within the National Police Service of Kenya that is mandated to receive and investigate complaints against the police. The IAU is supposed to conduct thorough, timely and impartial investigations of alleged police misconduct. The unit’s aim is to promote higher standards of professionalism and discipline within the police and to improve the internal accountability processes and thus improve the relationship between the police and society. ">Internal Affairs Unit </a>, has to be improved. “The IPOA does not always have access to police reports”, the journalist says. “So what needs to improve is the police commander accountability, meaning the accountability processes within the police itself. And we have to make sure that these officers who have been abusing human rights and been bribing legal authorities are not in the system anymore.” Only then, reliable accountability structures can be established.</p>

            <p>Another aspect of the systemic problems within the Kenyan police forces are the small size of police forces and the poor training officers receive, especially of top commanders. „The police has to be taken through leadership and management trainings“, says Hassan Abdille. „Because the senior officers that are in office for a long time, have not had proper training in human rights issues and leadership structures.” Furthermore, efforts of reducing the level of corruption within the police force should be intensified. Although the Kenyan government has carried out some <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Although Kenya’s fight against corruption dates back to the year 2002, when president Kibaki introduced some major anti-corruption laws and established the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission, corruption remained entrenched in several national sectors since the commission was prone to political influence and abuse. Besides other laws, the Kenyan government established the  Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) in 2010, whose mission is to promote integrity and combat corruption through law enforcement, prevention and education. Although the EACC is supposed to act independently, the appointment and removal of commissioners of the EACC needs the approval of the president and the parliament. The risk of political influence and abuse is therefore still present, which contributes to the constant low ranking of Kenya on the Global Corruption Perception Index. ">anti-corruption reforms</a>, these do not seem to have the intended effect.</p>

            <p>Especially when it comes to counter-terrorism operations the experts are sure that changes are necessary.  “Of course we can not advocate for terrorists”, says Hassan Abdille. “But we must be able to apply the rule of law. We must be able to justify and give proof and evidence that a person is actually a terrorist. So far, that does not happen in Kenya.” One solution to the problem would be to introduce harsher background checks and proper investigations of alleged terror related activities.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, a soft approach to countering violent extremism should be promoted, where the security forces work closely with the communities in order to tackle radicalisation. Only in 2016 did Kenya launch a National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism (NSCVE). The strategy calls “individuals and groups at the national and community level” into action and aims to complement the existing security-focused measures with a soft approach consisting in the provision of employment options and business opportunities amongst others to reduce youth vulnerability to extremism<sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>. However, the NSCVE is still in its early stages and faces various difficulties. Consequently, it is defeated by the hard approach of the global war on terror and by the acceptance of the excessive use of force when it comes to targeting terrorists.</p>

            <p>Many independent organisations, such as Haki Africa, have initiated anti-radicalization programs in coordination with the government, but nevertheless the killings and disappearances are continuing. “Only a few days ago an 18 year old guy was picked up by unknown police officers and has not been since”, says Hussein Khalid. “And then two Somali were shot dead in Kwale for alleged links to Al-Shabaab. These are things that really take us back.” In general, it seems as if improvements in countering terrorism in Kenya are frequently stifled by endemic and persistent structures that enable police violence. So without fundamental reforms of the security sector, police violence is likely to persist.</p>
