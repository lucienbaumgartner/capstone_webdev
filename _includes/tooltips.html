Most  human rights organisations - like for example Haki Africa -  then verify the statements by going to the scene of the incident and collect any evidence they can find. Afterwards, the evidence is presented to the police. Once the police confirms, the human rights organisation follow up with other actors like the forensic institute or the court. In the reports of the human rights organisations, only those cases where the veracity of information could be confirmed were included.

The conflict was a response to several attacks targeted at the Kenyan government facilities by the Northern Province People’s Progressive Party (NPPPP), a political party representing the Somali people of the Northern Province. The Kenyan government fought a severe war against the Kenyan Somali seeking union with the Somali Republic, the number of victims lying between 4000 and 6000 individuals. The Kenyan government was heavily criticised for forcing civilians into “protected villages”, which can be seen as concentration camps, and for killing  a large amount of the livestock kept by Somalis. The war ended in 1976, when Somalia’s Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, signed a treaty of ceasefire with Kenya. ">shifta war</a>

Today, absentee landlords, often belonging to prominent political families, own most of the prime land. A report of the Ministry of Lands published in 2009 explains that they own almost 77’7000 hectares of land, leaving almost 130’000 people as squatters. Hence, to the already existing intra-coastal division over land came an increasing tension between coastal people and people with origins in other parts of the country which contributed to a narrative of coastal dispossession and discrimination against Muslims.
