              <p>The relationship between Muslims, the Kenyan state and its security forces has always been tense and shaped by prejudices. Hassan Mwakimako, an associate professor of Islamic Studies at Pwani University in Kilifi, explains: “For a long time, Kenyan Muslims have felt alienated from the state and are under the impression that the state has marginalized their communities.”</p>

              <p>Ten percent of Kenya’s population belong to the Muslim faith<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. Although nominally secular, Kenya is often described as being “in practice a Christian state” due to the mainly Christian personnel in administration and politics or because of the role the Christian faith plays in political addresses to the public<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. This tense relationship is not only limited to the state and is most probably rooted in historical cultural prejudices against Muslims. The recent increase of terrorist attacks in Kenya and around the world has hardened the already existing anti-Muslim perceptions among many Kenyans<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>In Kenya, hostility towards Islam often focuses on the Somali people living there. Mostly Muslim, they are perceived as “Kenya’s most intimate enemy” - a result of a history of mutual distrust and violence between the Kenyan state and its ethnic Somali population. This relationship has worsened with the arrival of an increasing number of Somali refugees who flee civil war in their home country and with the threat of terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group based in Somalia<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Kenya’s ethnic Somali population predominantly resides in the three northeastern counties of  Mandera, Garissa and Wajir, which are recognized to be amongst the fourteen most marginalized regions in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. Having been under British control since 1925 but originally once part of Jubaland (in present-day southern Somalia), the regions were integrated into the newly independent Kenyan state in 1963. This happened despite a strong preference among the population to join the newly formed Somali Republic. During the resulting <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Shifta War (1963-1967) was a secessionist conflict between ethnic Somalis living in the Northern Provinces of Kenya and the Kenyan government. The conflict was a response to several attacks targeted at the Kenyan government facilities by the Northern Province People’s Progressive Party (NPPPP), a political party representing the Somali people of the Northern Province. The Kenyan government fought a severe war against the Kenyan Somali seeking union with the Somali Republic, the number of victims lying between 4000 and 6000 individuals. The Kenyan government was heavily criticised for forcing civilians into “protected villages”, which can be seen as concentration camps, and for killing  a large amount of the livestock kept by Somalis. The war ended in 1976, when Somalia’s Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, signed a treaty of ceasefire with Kenya. ">Shifta War</a> (1963-1967) and the Emergency Rule upheld until 1991, Kenya’s ethnic Somali population was a target of collective punishments, massacres and the so-called “forced villagisation”, a resettlement of scattered communities that took place to gain better control of them<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The fact that 58 percent<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> of all the refugees in Kenya come from Somalia fosters fear and mistrust within the Kenyan population. Repeatedly, the Kenyan government has tried to shut down refugee camps by raising concerns about security and the threat of terrorism from the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab that poses a constant threat to Kenya’s security. The fact that the press coverage increasingly connects Somali people to those security issues has helped confirm, not improve, their reputation for being defiant, unreliable and ‘foreign’<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The prejudices against people of Somali background also affect other Muslim groups that mainly live in Kenya’s coastal provinces. Similarly to the northeastern region, the coastal population has a precarious relationship with the Kenyan state. The narrative of marginalization there mainly focuses on the concept of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The issue of land tenure in Kenya can be traced back to the pre-colonial period, when Arab invaders disenfranchised indigenous landowners and established their land-rights within the law. Today, absentee landlords, often belonging to prominent political families, own most of the prime land. A report of the Ministry of Lands published in 2009 explains that they own almost 77’7000 hectares of land, leaving almost 130’000 people as squatters. Hence, to the already existing intra-coastal division over land came an increasing tension between coastal people and people with origins in other parts of the country which contributed to a narrative of coastal dispossession and discrimination against Muslims. ">land tenure</a>, which affects both Muslims and Christians<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>. Until today, inequalities in land distribution are a massive problem in Kenya, especially in the coastal areas, where vast parts of the prime land is owned by absentee landlords from prominent political families, leaving almost 130’000 people as squatters. Muslim communities and especially religious or political leaders have often used the consequences of coastal dispossession to stress the discrimination of Muslims in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Indeed, a 2013 published Final Report of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya laments the under-development of Muslim-inhabited communities, their underrepresentation in national politics, educational shortcomings and employment-related disadvantages. The main issue for Muslims, however, is the access to national Identity Cards. Kenyan Muslims are often exposed to vetting and harassment when applying for them. Yet, in Kenya, IDs are imperative when registering as a voter, receiving governmental services, enjoying the right of free movement, possessing property, or applying for universities. Furthermore, inhabitants of the northeastern provinces in particular are unproportionally checked at police controls, where the possession of an ID is mandatory<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>

                  <span class="victim-name">Witness Statement</span> <br> On June 29, 2015, three men went to the home of 45-year-old Farah Ibrahim Korio, an ethnic Somali Kenyan and teacher of Islamic education in Wajir, northeastern Kenya. When they did not find him, the three men threatened to arrest his family, if they did not disclose his whereabouts. The men had no uniforms that could have identified them as police men, neither did they reveal their identity. Still, they arrested the shopkeeper at a nearby shop, mistaking him for Farah, but dumped him on the road miles away when they realized their mistake.
                  <span class="read-more-target">When Farah learned that some unknown people were looking for him, he agreed to meet at Wajir police station. From there, he got abducted by the same three men, according to eyewitnesses. Police told Farah’s family that the three men were military intelligence officers and had taken him to the Anti-Terror Police Unit. That was the last time Farah’s family saw him. The ATPU denied having seen him and suggested that he might be in Wajir military camp. [Kenya: Killings, Disappearances by Anti-Terror Police, Human Rights Watch]</span><br>

              <p>Hassan Mwakimako confirms that Muslims and particularly Somali are oftentimes targeted by the police based on cultural profiling, a practice which focuses on stereotypes. “There have been attempts to use the law to profile Muslims and sometimes even undermine their rights”, says Mwakimako. <br>
                Contributing to this issue is the ethnic deployment of high-ranking police officers across the country. This strategy is mostly applied during periods of unrest, including the aftermath of terror attacks, or in times of elections. “Officers aligned to the incumbent or the regime in power are deployed mostly in areas dominated by ethnic communities that are perceived to be opposed to the presidency or that regime”, Stars-journalist Ramadhan Rajab explains. According to Hassan Abdille from Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI) this strategy is also implemented in the coast region, a traditional opposition stronghold: “During the elections we had only two communities deployed here from the police. The president’s family and the deputy president’s tribe. All the police heads were coming from those communities.”</p>
