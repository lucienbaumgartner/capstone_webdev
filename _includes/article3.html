              <p>The historically tense relationship between Muslims and the state has continued to deteriorate following an increasing number of terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations in Muslim-majority regions. As a frontline state in the global war on terror, Kenya has beared the greatest brunt of terrorism in the region. Terrorist attacks in Kenya increased dramatically in October 2011, after Kenya deployed its military to Somalia on its northeastern borders in an attempt to weaken Al-Shabaab and hinder its capacity to launch attacks in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. Since then, there have been multiple devastating attacks in Nairobi as well as in the coastal and northeastern regions in Kenya. Among the most deadly were the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Saturday, 21. September 2013, Nairobi: Four gunmen launched an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall, a luxury shopping Mall in Nairobi’s Westland district. During the attack at least 67 people were killed and 175 were wounded. The four assassins were shot in the Mall as well. In the aftermath of the attack the Mall was being looted, even by Kenyan soldiers sent in to rescue people and kill the perpetrators. Al-Shabaab quickly claimed responsibility for the attack stating it was retribution for Kenya’s military involvement in Somalia.">Westgate Mall Attack </a> in September 2013, the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Saturday, 5. July 2014, Lamu: The village Hindi in Lamu County got raided by more than 10 heavily armed men. At around the same time the village Gamba in Tana River County was attacked too and the militants tried to free alleged Al-Shabaab members held in custody in the local police station. During these two attacks 29 people got killed by the perpetrators. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility stating it was retribution for the stealing of land from Muslim communities. The attacks heavily impacted Kenya’s tourism sector.">Lamu Attack</a> in June 2014, and the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Thursday, 2. April 2015, Garissa: During an attack on Garissa University College 148 people, mostly students, got killed and several more got wounded. The assassins were killing Christian students, while letting Muslims go. The attack ended, when the police killed all of the perpetrators. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility stating it was retribution for Kenya’s military involvement in Somalia and that it was carried out at the college because the University was a Christian colony on Muslim lands. ">attack on the Garissa University College</a> in April 2015 in which 148 students were held hostage and killed<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. There were also attacks on the Kenyan Defense Forces deployed in Somalia, as occurred on January 2016, when Al-Shabaab allegedly killed over 100 KDF (Kenya Defense Forces) soldiers in the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Friday, 15. January 2016, El Adde: After an explosion caused by a suicide bomber at the gate of the Kenyan Military Base in El Adde Somalia more than 150 Al-Shabaab militants attacked the base holding around 200 Kenyan soldiers. Al-Shabaab claimed to have killed more than 100 of those soldiers and capture twelve, including the commanding officer. It is estimated though that the number of casualties is even higher. But since this would mean the biggest defeat for the Kenyan Military since Kenyan independence, the government tried to cover up the real extent of the attack. Therefore, the real number of victims remains unclear.">Battle of El Adde</a><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The frequency and magnitude of the attacks have exposed Kenya’s vulnerability and weak defense capacity. With key industries such as tourism stalling, Kenyans are calling for greater security measures across the country<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. In the face of such a challenge, the Kenyan government has adopted security measures to contain the threat of terrorism, which have been in part funded with financial aid from countries like the US, the UK and Denmark. Since Kenya is considered a regional anchor state in the Horn of Africa and a strategic ally to the West’s counterterrorism efforts in the war on terror, these Western countries also provide Kenya with legal advice and training in counterterrorism operations<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>With funding provided by the counterterrorism initiatives, the Kenyan government has established two major terror-fighting organizations in the last decade: the Anti-terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC). The ATPU is the main Kenya Police unit responsible for responding to and investigating terrorist activity, while the National Counterterrorism Centre coordinates all government counterterrorism efforts<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>In addition to these organizations, the Kenyan state has also taken legal measures to fight terrorism within its borders. In 2012, a new bill called the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed in an attempt to readdress terrorist security threats<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. The Prevention of Terrorism Act remains the main legal framework through which counter-terrorism measures can be affected in the country, although several amendments were ratified following criticisms by members of the Muslim community and several human rights groups.</p>

              <p>Court judgements against suspected terrorists, however, are rare. It seems to be too difficult to gather enough evidence-based information and to find witnesses willing to testify in court<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>. Instead, anti-terrorism security forces like the ATPU have used the fight against terrorism as an excuse for the excessive use of force as happened to Abubakar Shariff, a prominent and controversial Islamic cleric who had faced several terrorism charges in court, but could never be convicted. He was finally killed leaving a courtroom<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. In addition to this, critics are concerned that due to <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Prevention of Terrorism Act, for example, criminalizes all activities that “create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public”, “result in serious damage to property”, or that “prejudice national security of public safety”, without further clarification. The Kenyan legislation also loosely defines “terrorism” as any activity carried out with the intent of “intimidating or causing fear amongst members of the public or a section of the public,” “intimidating or compelling the Government or international organization to do, or refrain from any act,” or “destabilizing the religious, political, constitutional, economic or social institutions of a country, or an international organization.” ">overly vague definitions of terrorism</a>, police forces could potentially expand their power against political opponents, civil society, religious and ethnic groups, minorities, or any other vulnerable group<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

The police claimed that the 28-year-old was involved in a terrorist attack on Hidaya Mosque in Eastleigh, Nairobi, where six people died and 15 were wounded. Family members of Lenox Swalleh claimed, however, that he was killed on the way home from morning prayers.
                <span class="read-more-target">Multiple witnesses confirmed that the young man was at the mosque that morning. But there is further evidence that he could not have been part of the terror attack on Hidaya Mosque. On the day of the attack Lenox David Swalleh was actually in prison on charges of organized crime and links to Al-Shabaab. While in prison, the ATPU officers interrogating him apparently threatened to kill him, if he got released. (Kenya: Killings, Disappearances by Anti-Terror Police, Human Rights Watch)</span>

              <p>A closer look at our data indicates that human rights violations by the police increase especially when the threat of terrorism in Kenya is high. Comparing the number of human rights violations recorded in our database with the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The number of terror attacks is reported by the Global Terrorism Database. The Global Terrorism Database is an open-source project started at the University of Maryland including data for over 170’000 terror incidents all over the world from 1970 up until 2016. It contains information on date, location, the weapons used, type of target, number of casualties and perpetrator. The information is gathered from open media sources and only added if the source is deemed credible and thus making it currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world. ">number of terror attacks</a> that happened in Kenya per month, we see a strikingly similar trend. Contrasting the peaks in the trend lines, it is interesting to see that the peaks occur more or less at the same time. However, the peaks in the count of recorded human rights violations become larger over time, while the peaks in the number of terror incidents stay relatively stable. This might indicate that the police has indeed been abusing anti-terror laws more frequently in the recent years. </p>

              <p>It is important to note that an increase in human rights violations could also be attributed to the fact that most reports used to collect data date from 2015 and 2016 and therefore may cause an overrepresentation of more recent cases. What is more, comparing the peaks it could be argued that counter-terrorism operations sometimes are sheer reactions to attacks, rather than carefully planned operations against terror-suspects. This impression is shared by Hussein Khalid: “The police is reacting to terror attacks in knee-jerk operations that should show the public that they are actually doing something against the threat of terrorism. However, there is no system in place in these operations.”</p>

              <p>Khalid further claims that the police are likely to have used major terror incidents as a cover up for other actions. “Haki Africa was shut down after the Garissa University attack. Moreover, after the Westgate incident, the government opened up a concentration camp of some sort where people of Somali origin were put for days”, he says, referring to <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="At the beginning of April 2014, the Kenyan government launched a massive crackdown on terror, known as the “Operation Usalama Watch”. According to Kenyan officials, the operation is aimed at detecting illegal immigrants, arresting and prosecuting people suspected of engaging in terrorism and identifying herds of radicalization and lawlessness. The government introduced Usalama Watch after several terrorists happened at the beginning of 2014 in Nairobi and Mombasa. Amnesty International and other human rights organisation claim that the operation led to several human rights violations in the name of national security and is disproportionately focused on the Somali community.  "><i>Usalama Watch</i></a>. This operation was carried out in spring 2014 and lead to the arbitrary arrest, relocation, harassment and expulsion of hundreds of Somali immigrants locating in Nairobi’s Eastleigh district<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>According to Hassan Mwakimako, the introduction of the anti-terror bills has led to an increase of violence against Muslims in Kenya and to a suppression of their rights. “The war on terror has led to arbitrary arrests and disrespect to the Muslim traditions. Policemen were sent to several Mosques and distracted prayers or even detained clerics who they said to be radicalizing members of their community.”</p>

              <p>Although some of the Muslim victims targeted by the police were either proven or suspected terrorists, human rights groups have found that security forces appear to indiscriminately target Kenyan and Somali Muslims, regardless of their age or affiliation to terrorist groups. “Muslim communities in Kenya are considered to be suspect communities”, says Hassan Abdille. “Muslims are specifically targeted by the police and go through a lot of harassment. This is why they are feeling marginalized, oppressed and victimized.”</p>

              <p>A Human Rights Watch<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> report published in 2014 revealed that a police raid intended to capture Islamic extremists unfairly targeted innocent civilians. Professor Mwakimako confirms these findings and sheds further light on the situation: “In the event of any terrorist attacks, usually the reaction of the police is to arbitrarily arrest people, to arbitrarily get into people’s houses and in many cases to destroy people’s properties. Muslims that are within the vicinity of where the terrorist attack has happened are most likely going to suffer”, he says. “Even if these people live very far away from the locations of the terrorist attacks, police will go after them and accuse them of involvement in the attacks."</p>

During the transport to Mpeketoni, Mugo claims to have been severely beaten and kicked by the officers. The multiple arrestees were forced to lay down on the floor on top of each other and were stepped on, kicked and beaten by the guards.
                <span class="read-more-target"> Afterwards, they were put in a cell with ten previously arrested men. The cell was so small that the prisoners had to stand upright for two days. They were not allowed to use the toilet, but were given a bucket to relieve themselves. Ali Mugo was then charged on three counts:  (i) Murder of 95 people in Hindi, Mpeketoni and Gamba, (ii) Forcefully evicting people from Hindi, Mpeketoni and Gamba; and (iii) Destruction of public property. He pleaded not guilty and got released due to lack of evidence. It took Ali Mugo two whole weeks to be able to walk again.	(The error of fighting terror with terror, KNCHR)</span>

              <p>Hussein Khalid complains that as soon as the police considers someone as a terror suspect, they are as good as guilty. “Once you are declared a suspect, you lose all your rights and the police can do whatever they want. As a terror suspect, you are guilty until proven innocent.“ He also claims that this problem has begun to spill over to civil society and has now even been used to get rid of business rivals. “We have had incidents where people have fights on different issues and will then report their opponent as being involved in terror, because they know that once you are tagged with that, the police will do anything.”</p>
