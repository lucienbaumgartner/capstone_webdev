              <p>Even though the ATPU is specialized in carrying out counter-terrorism operations, it is by far not the only unit involved in fighting terrorism. The data analysed for this article reveals the presence of many other security forces, namely units of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The National Police Service of Kenya is incorporated into the Ministry of Interior of Coordination of National Government and consists of the Kenya Police Service (KPS), the Administration Police Service (APS) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI). All of them are governed by the Inspector-General of Police but have different Deputy Inspector-Generals. Both the KPS and the APS are responsible for assisting the public, maintaining law and order, protecting life and property. The APS has some additional tasks like border control and security. For historic reasons, they have co-existed under different command structures until the implementation of a new constitution and the National Police Service Act in 2011. The DCI  is responsible for detecting and investigating serious crimes but they also provide criminal intelligence. Accordingly, the ATPU belongs to the DCI. In addition to this, the Kenya Police Reserve exists mainly in rural areas to assist the police units. Moreover, there are various militia, vigilante groups, gangs and private security firms. ">the National Police Service</a> like the General Service Unit (GSU) and forces merely described as ‘Police’ as well as units belonging to the Administration Police, such as the Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) and the Border Patrol Unit (BPU). In addition to this, the Kenya Police Reserve (KPR), the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) are reportedly active in counter-terrorism operations<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Whereas the multi-agency strategy might be a reasonable approach from a security perspective – especially since <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The police-public ratio refers to the number of police officers by head of population. According to the World Internal Security & Police Report from 2016, Kenya’s police force is quite small, with only 99 officers per 100’000 civilians. The average of all countries analysed by the report lies at 347 officers per 100’000 civilians. The private security industry in Kenya is also quite small with only 136 private security employees per 100,000 people by an Index average of 330. However, according to our interviewees the number of private agencies could be much higher, as the regulation of the security sector was established only recently, with the signature of the Private Security Industry Regulation Bill in 2016.  ">the police-public ratio</a> in Kenya is low<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> – it proves disastrous for civil society and human rights organizations seeking to follow up on claims of excessive use of force. Hassan Abdille stated during an interview that his team was initially “completely confused” by the presence of the many agencies. He believes that the multi-agency approach is a means to distract from the actions of the ATPU, which has been exposed to and whose work has been criticized heavily by the public.  “If someone from the KWS kills an individual, people will think that this person must have been suspected of crimes like poaching”, explains Hassan Abdille, since poaching is a severe crime in Kenya and can be punished with heavy fines or life sentences. As reported by various newspapers, Kenya’s government is even considering the introduction of death penalties for poachers<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, it is is widely stated that various security forces use the counter-terrorism context as a cover-up strategy. An Al-Jazeera documentary on this issue stated that victims of police violence are often called “terrorists” as a way to ward off questions posed regarding excessive use of force. Philip Alston, former United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, contends that it is a standard strategy for the police to create shootout scenarios at crime scenes, even when the persons killed were unarmed<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>. This is contributing to the high number of agencies involved in “counter-terrorism operations”.</p>

              <p>Most importantly, the multi-agency approach of the Kenyan security services hinders the efforts of human rights organizations to follow up on citizens’ complaints of excessive use of force by the police. Both witnesses and victims are sometimes unable to recognize the security forces involved because they often do not show a form of identity such as a badge. To make matters worse, some of the security forces wear similar camouflage uniforms and drive unmarked vehicles<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. Since the jurisdiction of the security forces also remains unclear, it is usually difficult to identify the respective forces.</p>

              <p>Overall, the data we analyzed indicates that the ATPU, the KDF, and the regular police are the three main players in counter-terrorism operations. These three units were involved in almost 70 percent of all cases, which could be due to the circumstance that the KDF, the ATPU and the Police are the only forces operating in all parts of the country.</p>

              <p>The regional distribution of the cases shows that the KDF is mostly involved in the coastal and northeastern part of Kenya. The northeastern cities of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa are described as “violent extremism hotspots”<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> due to their proximity to the porous border with Somalia. Consequently these cities historically have had a high military presence and a particularly low police-to-public ratio.</p>

              <p>The domestic deployment of the KDF, which is predominant in those cities, is only allowed in situations of unrest or instability to restore peace as well as in cases of emergency or disaster in order to assist other authorities. Both actions have to first be approved by the National Assembly and then issued in the Gazette, the official publication of the government of Kenya. These requirements have not been met so far. It seems that police officers often feel intimidated by military personnel and are unwilling to investigate abuses committed by the KDF. And what’s more,  the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), an organisation entitled to investigate misconducts by the Police and enhance professionalism within the National Police Service, has no mandate to investigate KDF misconducts either.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></p>

              <p>Concerning cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of suspected terrorists, the ATPU and the police are each responsible for around 30 to 38 percent of the reported incidences. Rather strikingly, the police is also accused of having been involved in 77 percent of executions of individuals who had no clear links to terrorism. These figures confirm an image of a ‘trigger-happy’ police described by Hassan Mwakimako and Khalid Hussein and  several other observers. When it comes to the enforced disappearances of people who had no clear and confirmed links to terrorism, 45 percent of these cases could be attributed to the the police. However, the KDF and the ATPU are also accused of having participated in 23 percent and 17 percent of enforced disappearances, respectively. This leads to the conclusion that the ATPU and the KDF operate primarily on issues related to terrorism, especially when it comes to killings – although in the case of enforced disappearances, they also target people with unclear links to terrorism-related activities. The picture that can be drawn of the police, on the other hand, confirms the argument that the excessive use of force by Kenya’s security forces is deeply entrenched in the system.</p>

              <p>Indeed, the use of excessive force used by the Kenyan security forces to fight terrorism is highly related to general police violence in Kenya. The Kenyan police is rated to be the third worst police force in 2016 in the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The World Internal Security and Police Index is a measurement of internal security introduced by the Sharjah Police Department  and the International Police Science Association and developed by the Institute for Economics and Peace in 2016. The Index takes into account the ability of security institutions to maintain security, the effectiveness of those services and the general public’s perception of the police and security. Out of all the 127 countries in the analysis, Kenya ranked third worst when it comes the capacity, process, legitimacy and outcomes of its internal security. The poor ranking of Kenya is explained with the low capacity of the police force due to the small police-public ratio, as well as because of corruption and political terror. "><i>World Internal Security & Police Report</i></a>. This ranking was mainly justified by high corruption and excessive use of force as well as low capacity and restricted access to resources<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. There were complaints that the Kenyan police efforts lack a research-led approach, strategies of intelligence gathering and careful analysis and that the slow adoption of information technologies hinder information sharing between the units. Accordingly, trust in the police is low. One in every three Kenyans claims to have experienced some sort of police misconduct or abuse<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Hussein Khalid cites a popular phrase claiming that “if one was to be given a choice to find themselves in a dark alley with either the police or a robber, Kenyans say that they rather have the robber than the police officer.” Likewise an IMLU-report states that there are more chances in Kenya to be killed by a police officer than by any other person. Furthermore, the police department is said to be the corruptest department in the government<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>According to Ramadhan Rajab, journalist from the Nairobi based news agency The Star, excessive use of force is not only a consequence of poor policing strategies, but can be traced back to colonial times. “It seems as if the Kenyan police has not dropped the colonial mindset of policing”, he says. “The police officers think they can only enforce the law through violence.” Philip Alston confirmed in a 2009 report<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> that violence is deeply entrenched in the Kenyan police sector. Alston concluded that “police in Kenya frequently execute individuals and that the climate of impunity prevails. Most troubling is the existence of police death squads operating on the orders of senior police officials and charged with eliminating suspected leaders and members of criminal organizations.”</p>

              <p>Partly as a reaction to Alston’s report but mostly triggered by increasing criticism within Kenya, there have been constitutional changes of the police system, including staff turnover, the installation of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Office of Director for Public Prosecutions is an independent prosecution authority mandated  by the Constitution to prosecute all criminal cases in the country. The authority’s core tasks include among other the prosecution of those charged by the police and other investigative agencies with criminal offences while upholding, protecting and promoting human and constitutional rights. Furthermore, the office is supposed to monitor the training and appointment of Public Prosecutors in Statutory Corporations,  to address complaints raised by members of the public, watchdog bodies and other institution and to address parliamentary questions relating to administration of criminal justice. ">the Office of the Director for Public Prosecutions </a>, and the establishment of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) is an organisation entitled to investigate misconducts by the Police and enhance professionalism within the National Police Service. The vision of IPOA is to establish a robust civilian accountability mechanism that promotes public trust and confidence in the National Police Service by conducting impartial and independent investigations of the police sector. IPOA is supposed to investigate any deaths and serious injuries caused by police action to prevent impunity and enhance accountability. IPOA is allowed to conduct inspections of police premises, to monitor and review actions by the internal affairs unit of the police and to investigate police operations and the deployment of officers. ">the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)</a><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>. Complaints from both members of the public and police officers are collected and analysed by the IPOA. Every six months the IPOA is supposed to summarize these reports and inform the public of its activities and provide recommendations for improvement of the functioning of the National Police Service.</p>

              <p>Although the IPOA has been operating since 2012, police violence is still prevalent. According to Ramadhan Rajab, changes brought about by the reforms are not yet sustainable. “Even though the young police officers might be trained in modern ways of policing – without the use of excessive violence – when they come to the field, they get in contact with the older senior police officers who believe in violence as the ultima ratio”, he says.</p>

              <p>For Ramadhan Rajab, the issue of police violence is an issue of impunity. “It’s not like the officers are legally immune”, the journalist says. “But the problem is that external oversight authorities like the IPOA rely on police to gather information and evidence in order to nail officers who have violated the law.” This is – according to Ramadhan Rajab – highly problematic, because the commanders who are supposed to give evidence to the IPOA to allow them to prosecute criminal officers, do not always report. “So the criminal officers still walk around”, the journalist says. “Sometimes they even commit crimes with the blessing of the top commanders.”</p>

              <p>Hussein Khalid and Hassan Abdille share this view. Khalid complains that none of  the 81 cases his organization had handed over to the IPOA in 2016 has been investigated until 2018. He does not blame IPOA itself that “has done its bits”, but the government which has “intentionally under-resourced them”. A look at the institution’s “End-Term Board Report 2012-2018” confirms this assessment: From the 5085 cases received for investigation 64 were before courts at the time of publication and in only 3 cases had a conviction been made<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>. Both Abdille and Khalid agree that there is “zero accountability in the police force”. It is “absolutely terrible”, Abdille emphasizes.</p>
