              <p>Abdirahman Ahmed Dakane, a teacher in Garissa, Kenya, was arrested at work in August 2015 by police officers attached to the Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU). The 30-year old man of Somali origin had been working with the US-organization Advocates for Human Rights to seek justice for victims of police violence in Garissa County. According to eyewitnesses, Dakane was arrested for cooperating with the enemy outside Kenya. The officers beat him up and hauled him away. Dakane has not been seen since<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The case of  Abdirahman Ahmed Dakane is just one example of violence against civilians by the Kenyan police- and security forces. Between the years of 2011 and 2016 human rights organisations, newspapers and other independent agencies collected several hundred <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Most of the data that has been collected relies on statements from eyewitnesses. Oftentimes these are relatives of the victims. The witnesses report the incidents to human rights organisations or the police and fill in a report.  Most  human rights organisations - like for example Haki Africa -  then verify the statements by going to the scene of the incident and collect any evidence they can find. Afterwards, the evidence is presented to the police. Once the police confirms, the human rights organisation follow up with other actors like the forensic institute or the court. In the reports of the human rights organisations, only those cases where the veracity of information could be confirmed were included. For the report from Haki Africa, for example, these were 81 cases, although the NGO collected around 300 statements of police violence.">witness statements</a> of police violence or violence against civilians. The 323 human rights violations in our database include arbitrary arrests, extortion, illegal detention, torture, killings and disappearances. In total, we found 127 so-called <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="According to the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International, an enforced disappearance refers to the arrest, detention or abduction of persons, by or with the authorization, consent or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by either (1) a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of freedom or (2) a refusal to give information on the fate of ‘’disappeared’’ persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.">enforced disappearances</a> and 112 <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="According to the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International, an extrajudicial execution is an unlawful and deliberate killing carried out by order of a government or by governmental institutions like the police. It can also be referred to as a political or “death squad” killing. ">extrajudicial killings</a> in the 5-year-period. The victims were often rounded up and detained for hours or even days without any legal basis. Many of them had also been tortured while in detention.</p>

              <p>Out of all the reported incidences, most victims were men aged between 20 and 40. In only four percent of the reported cases the victims were women. Over half of the 323 cases occurred in a context of counter-terrorism. The alleged terrorists are often linked to the Al-Shabaab movement or are suspected to have taken part in a terrorist attack.</p>

              <p>Upon taking a closer look at the people suspected of terrorism, it becomes clear that a high percentage of the suspected terrorists are Muslims (75 percent) or at least carry a Muslim name (95 percent). Hussein Khalid, Executive Director of the Kenyan Human Rights Organisation Haki Africa, acknowledges these findings. “When it comes to terror-related killings, I expect over 90 percent of the victims to be of Muslim faith”, he says. According to him, this has partly to do with the fact that many of the people engaging in terror activities are indeed of Muslim faith. The link of human rights violations to anti-terrorism operations, however, is a lot less prevalent in cases of enforced disappearances compared to extrajudicial killings.</p>

              <p>These results might be a first indication of the abuse of anti-terror laws by the police. Many human rights groups claim that since the introduction of anti-terror measures, the Kenyan police have covered up human rights violations committed by security agencies under the guise of counter-terrorism operations. „The anti terror-laws we have in Kenya have given the police power to disregard human rights and fundamental freedoms“, Hussein Khalid states.</p>

              <p>Some observers have gone a step further and claimed that, rather than mitigating terrorism in the country, Kenya’s counter-terrorism measures have led to an increase in physical insecurity and religious radicalization. “The human rights violations by the police, raids of places of worship and the passing of retrogressive anti-terror-laws have made the situation of radicalization<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> even worse”, says Hussein Khalid. In his opinion, a soft approach that would bring in religious or community leaders, or even politicians, to speak to communities and introduce alternatives to radical ideologies, would have better chances of succeeding at preventing terrorism.</p>

              <p>The reported cases, though, are just the tip of the iceberg, and the dark figure is estimated to be a lot higher. Many cases are not reported, often due to the simple fact that certain communities can not reach human rights organisations because they live in remote areas. However, for Khalid the main reason why so many cases go unreported is a different one, namely “that a lot of people are afraid of handing in witness statements has to do with the fact that we do not have a friendly police service”. Information could be leaked or misused by the police. “We had cases where people who were reporting to us were put in dangerous situations.” The legacy of police violence in Kenya and the fact that weak accountability structures and corruption secure the power of the police might further weaken the trust of the citizens in Kenyan security services.</p>

              <p>The fact that a lot of cases go unreported might also influence the regional distribution of the cases. Most violent encounters were reported in the big cities like Nairobi, Mombasa or Garissa. When looking at Muslims specifically, most human rights violations by Kenyan security forces are reported in three regions. First, there is the former Coast Province, which today consists of the Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu and Taita-Taveta counties. Most of the cases, however, are found in the city of Mombasa. Another hotspot is northeastern Kenya and its counties Mandera, Garissa and Wajir. Furthermore, one of the biggest number of victims within a single county was found in Nairobi.</p>

              <p>In Mombasa, Garissa and Mandera especially, the number of Muslim victims is high, with 97 percent of the victims being identified as Muslims. The reasons for this are twofold. On the one hand, most of the human rights organizations that reported incidences of excessive police violence against Muslims are located in those regions. On the other hand, these regions are historically inhabited by large Muslim communities and are a hotspot for radicalization, in part nourished by  a legacy of marginalization.</p>
