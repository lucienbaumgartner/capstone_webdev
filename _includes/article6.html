            <p>Our external capstone project partner, Amnesty International Nairobi, provided our team with a large record of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances that have occurred in Kenya. Amnesty International, together with other global non-governmental organizations, has successfully documented a total 375 cases of extrajudicial and enforced disappearances that have occurred in Kenya since the 1990s.  These have served as the basis of our analysis that focuses on the time period from 2011  to 2016.</p>

            <p>The primary sources of the data collected by Amnesty International can roughly be divided into two groups: reports from Human Rights Organizations and reports from newspaper articles. In addition to the original database provided, cases from other sources were included into our analysis. (A list of all the sources can be found <a href="../capstone_webdev/sources">here</a>).</p>

            <p>Cases mentioned in the human rights reports but disregarded in the original database by Amnesty International were included in the final database as well. Duplicates in the database were avoided by only adding victims that could be clearly identified.</p>

            <p>In order to structure the data for our analysis, we created a standardized codebook consisting of 32 variables. The codebook contains sociodemographic variables like <i>age</i>, <i>gender</i> and <i>occupation</i>, as well as person-specific variables like <i>religion</i>, a suspected Mungiki, and a suspected terrorist. The <i>current status</i> of a person “meaning whether a person is at home, missing or dead” is coded as well. Additionally, incident-specific variables like the <i>date</i> and <i>location</i> of the incident and information about the <i>security agencies</i> and the officers involved in the incident were coded. Coding included information on whether the incident was part of a <i>counter terrorism act</i> and whether the incident could be classified as an <i>enforced disappearance</i> or an <i>extrajudicial execution</i>. Finally, information about the <i>sources</i> and the <i>coder</i> are listed.</p>

            <p>Overall, 140 new cases were added to the original database, increasing the total number of cases in database to 515. For this article, however, only the data of the time period between 2011 and 2016 was taken into account. This is in part due to both political and social circumstances in Kenya and due to our research focus, as well as for the sake of robustness of the data since information is only consistently available within this specific time frame. Therefore, in this article, only 323 out of the 515 cases were considered for our analysis. From these cases around one third are cross validated by at least two sources.</p>

            <p>Due to the nature of our sources there is unfortunately no complete information on all the cases. The graph on missing values in our data shows that we mostly lack information about age and occupation of the victims. Also, the number of agencies involved and the names of the agencies involved is sometimes missing. This might be due to the problem of the multiple agency approach used by the Kenyan State, as mentioned in the article.</p>

            <p>The characteristics of our data and its sources lead to a considerable amount of uncertainty in our analysis. First of all, it has to be clear that the number of cases analysed are only the tip of the iceberg. A lot of the cases of police violence never get reported, neither to the state organs, nor to human rights groups. This might be because of fear of repercussions or because those people can not reach any institution to hand in there reports because they live in remote areas. On top of that, our data and the reports used are focused on counter terror operations and violations happening around them, however the problem is not limited to this. Excessive use of force by the police is a general problem in Kenya, as we have shown in our article.</p>

            <p>The fact that a valid amount of our cases are from newspaper sources brings its own set of challenges. First, Nairobi, the city where most newspapers reside, is probably overrepresented in the cases reported by newspapers. Secondly, since newspapers are probably not as detailed in their case descriptions as the human rights reports, there seems to be a high number of cases were the police, as a general term, is named as perpetrator. Also, since newspaper do not have a focus on counter terrorism, like the human rights reports, a high number of cases obtained from newspaper articles are concerning victims that are no suspected terrorists. Combined with the first point made about Nairobi, this might account for the relatively high number of non muslim cases reported in Nairobi. Another problem regarding the inclusion of newspaper as sources is that it was not feasible to collect cases reported in newspaper systematically.</p>

            <p>The other type of primary sources used, reports by human rights organizations, are also challenging. Although the human rights organisation have used a more systematic approach in collecting statements, there reports focus strongly on counter terrorism and on specific regions. The reports specifically cover Nairobi, northeastern Kenya (Human Rights Watch), and the coastal regions (Haki Africa). This distribution makes sense since this is where the majority of terror attacks occurred and where human rights violations also most likely happened. Haki Africa even has a special team, a so-called SWAT team, which is deployed to the location of a terrorist attack or similar incident in the immediate aftermath to report violations. However, these situations might be increasing the number of cases reported after terror attacks, since there is a concentrated effort in that instance to collect them. In the regions where the human rights organizations work, the share of muslims in the community is especially high. This fact could have contributed to the high share of muslim cases in our data. Overall, the problem of human rights violations by the police might not be as heavily linked to Muslims as this article might suggest.</p>

            <p>All these limitations, however, do not lead us to believe that our findings are invalid or that we paint a false picture of reality. Instead, the limitations are likely an indication that police violence  is more prevalent than portrayed in our analysis, due to unreported cases not included in this database.</p>
