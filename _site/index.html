            <hr>
            <p>In Kenya, human rights violations by the police have become an endemic problem. Over the last decade, Kenya’s security agencies have repeatedly been accused of corruption, complicity with criminals, and violating human rights.</p>
            <p>With the emergence of anti-terror laws in the wake of rising islamist terrorism, these accusations have become even louder. In response, human rights organizations have monitored and documented several hundred cases of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings, most of them allegedly disguised as part of anti-terror operations.</p>
            <p>Based on expert interviews and previously unpublished data gathered by Amnesty International Kenya, we investigate the potential systematic targeting by security forces and provide possible explanations for these patterns of violence focusing on the historical distrust between Kenya’s Muslim population and the state, the police’s counter-terrorism approach, and weak accountability structures within the police.</p>

              <p>Abdirahman Ahmed Dakane, a teacher in Garissa, Kenya, was arrested at work in August 2015 by police officers attached to the Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU). The 30-year old man of Somali origin had been working with the US-organization Advocates for Human Rights to seek justice for victims of police violence in Garissa County. According to eyewitnesses, Dakane was arrested for cooperating with the enemy outside Kenya. The officers beat him up and hauled him away. Dakane has not been seen since<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The case of  Abdirahman Ahmed Dakane is just one example of violence against civilians by the Kenyan police- and security forces. Between the years of 2011 and 2016 human rights organisations, newspapers and other independent agencies collected several hundred <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Most of the data that has been collected relies on statements from eyewitnesses. Oftentimes these are relatives of the victims. The witnesses report the incidents to human rights organisations or the police and fill in a report.  Most  human rights organisations - like for example Haki Africa -  then verify the statements by going to the scene of the incident and collect any evidence they can find. Afterwards, the evidence is presented to the police. Once the police confirms, the human rights organisation follow up with other actors like the forensic institute or the court. In the reports of the human rights organisations, only those cases where the veracity of information could be confirmed were included. For the report from Haki Africa, for example, these were 81 cases, although the NGO collected around 300 statements of police violence.">witness statements</a> of police violence or violence against civilians. The 323 human rights violations in our database include arbitrary arrests, extortion, illegal detention, torture, killings and disappearances. In total, we found 127 so-called <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="According to the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International, an enforced disappearance refers to the arrest, detention or abduction of persons, by or with the authorization, consent or acquiescence of a state or political organization, followed by either (1) a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of freedom or (2) a refusal to give information on the fate of ‘’disappeared’’ persons, with the intention of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period of time.">enforced disappearances</a> and 112 <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="According to the International Criminal Court and Amnesty International, an extrajudicial execution is an unlawful and deliberate killing carried out by order of a government or by governmental institutions like the police. It can also be referred to as a political or “death squad” killing. ">extrajudicial killings</a> in the 5-year-period. The victims were often rounded up and detained for hours or even days without any legal basis. Many of them had also been tortured while in detention.</p>

              <p>Out of all the reported incidences, most victims were men aged between 20 and 40. In only four percent of the reported cases the victims were women. Over half of the 323 cases occurred in a context of counter-terrorism. The alleged terrorists are often linked to the Al-Shabaab movement or are suspected to have taken part in a terrorist attack.</p>

              <p>Upon taking a closer look at the people suspected of terrorism, it becomes clear that a high percentage of the suspected terrorists are Muslims (75 percent) or at least carry a Muslim name (95 percent). Hussein Khalid, Executive Director of the Kenyan Human Rights Organisation Haki Africa, acknowledges these findings. “When it comes to terror-related killings, I expect over 90 percent of the victims to be of Muslim faith”, he says. According to him, this has partly to do with the fact that many of the people engaging in terror activities are indeed of Muslim faith. The link of human rights violations to anti-terrorism operations, however, is a lot less prevalent in cases of enforced disappearances compared to extrajudicial killings.</p>

              <p>These results might be a first indication of the abuse of anti-terror laws by the police. Many human rights groups claim that since the introduction of anti-terror measures, the Kenyan police have covered up human rights violations committed by security agencies under the guise of counter-terrorism operations. „The anti terror-laws we have in Kenya have given the police power to disregard human rights and fundamental freedoms“, Hussein Khalid states.</p>

              <p>Some observers have gone a step further and claimed that, rather than mitigating terrorism in the country, Kenya’s counter-terrorism measures have led to an increase in physical insecurity and religious radicalization. “The human rights violations by the police, raids of places of worship and the passing of retrogressive anti-terror-laws have made the situation of radicalization<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> even worse”, says Hussein Khalid. In his opinion, a soft approach that would bring in religious or community leaders, or even politicians, to speak to communities and introduce alternatives to radical ideologies, would have better chances of succeeding at preventing terrorism.</p>

              <p>The reported cases, though, are just the tip of the iceberg, and the dark figure is estimated to be a lot higher. Many cases are not reported, often due to the simple fact that certain communities can not reach human rights organisations because they live in remote areas. However, for Khalid the main reason why so many cases go unreported is a different one, namely “that a lot of people are afraid of handing in witness statements has to do with the fact that we do not have a friendly police service”. Information could be leaked or misused by the police. “We had cases where people who were reporting to us were put in dangerous situations.” The legacy of police violence in Kenya and the fact that weak accountability structures and corruption secure the power of the police might further weaken the trust of the citizens in Kenyan security services.</p>

            <div class="container">
              <p>The fact that a lot of cases go unreported might also influence the regional distribution of the cases. Most violent encounters were reported in the big cities like Nairobi, Mombasa or Garissa. When looking at Muslims specifically, most human rights violations by Kenyan security forces are reported in three regions. First, there is the former Coast Province, which today consists of the Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu and Taita-Taveta counties. Most of the cases, however, are found in the city of Mombasa. Another hotspot is northeastern Kenya and its counties Mandera, Garissa and Wajir. Furthermore, one of the biggest number of victims within a single county was found in Nairobi.</p>

              <p>In Mombasa, Garissa and Mandera especially, the number of Muslim victims is high, with 97 percent of the victims being identified as Muslims. The reasons for this are twofold. On the one hand, most of the human rights organizations that reported incidences of excessive police violence against Muslims are located in those regions. On the other hand, these regions are historically inhabited by large Muslim communities and are a hotspot for radicalization, in part nourished by  a legacy of marginalization.</p>

              <p>The relationship between Muslims, the Kenyan state and its security forces has always been tense and shaped by prejudices. Hassan Mwakimako, an associate professor of Islamic Studies at Pwani University in Kilifi, explains: “For a long time, Kenyan Muslims have felt alienated from the state and are under the impression that the state has marginalized their communities.”</p>

              <p>Ten percent of Kenya’s population belong to the Muslim faith<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>. Although nominally secular, Kenya is often described as being “in practice a Christian state” due to the mainly Christian personnel in administration and politics or because of the role the Christian faith plays in political addresses to the public<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>. This tense relationship is not only limited to the state and is most probably rooted in historical cultural prejudices against Muslims. The recent increase of terrorist attacks in Kenya and around the world has hardened the already existing anti-Muslim perceptions among many Kenyans<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>In Kenya, hostility towards Islam often focuses on the Somali people living there. Mostly Muslim, they are perceived as “Kenya’s most intimate enemy” - a result of a history of mutual distrust and violence between the Kenyan state and its ethnic Somali population. This relationship has worsened with the arrival of an increasing number of Somali refugees who flee civil war in their home country and with the threat of terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group based in Somalia<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Kenya’s ethnic Somali population predominantly resides in the three northeastern counties of  Mandera, Garissa and Wajir, which are recognized to be amongst the fourteen most marginalized regions in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>. Having been under British control since 1925 but originally once part of Jubaland (in present-day southern Somalia), the regions were integrated into the newly independent Kenyan state in 1963. This happened despite a strong preference among the population to join the newly formed Somali Republic. During the resulting <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Shifta War (1963-1967) was a secessionist conflict between ethnic Somalis living in the Northern Provinces of Kenya and the Kenyan government. The conflict was a response to several attacks targeted at the Kenyan government facilities by the Northern Province People’s Progressive Party (NPPPP), a political party representing the Somali people of the Northern Province. The Kenyan government fought a severe war against the Kenyan Somali seeking union with the Somali Republic, the number of victims lying between 4000 and 6000 individuals. The Kenyan government was heavily criticised for forcing civilians into “protected villages”, which can be seen as concentration camps, and for killing  a large amount of the livestock kept by Somalis. The war ended in 1976, when Somalia’s Prime Minister Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, signed a treaty of ceasefire with Kenya. ">Shifta War</a> (1963-1967) and the Emergency Rule upheld until 1991, Kenya’s ethnic Somali population was a target of collective punishments, massacres and the so-called “forced villagisation”, a resettlement of scattered communities that took place to gain better control of them<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The fact that 58 percent<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> of all the refugees in Kenya come from Somalia fosters fear and mistrust within the Kenyan population. Repeatedly, the Kenyan government has tried to shut down refugee camps by raising concerns about security and the threat of terrorism from the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab that poses a constant threat to Kenya’s security. The fact that the press coverage increasingly connects Somali people to those security issues has helped confirm, not improve, their reputation for being defiant, unreliable and ‘foreign’<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The prejudices against people of Somali background also affect other Muslim groups that mainly live in Kenya’s coastal provinces. Similarly to the northeastern region, the coastal population has a precarious relationship with the Kenyan state. The narrative of marginalization there mainly focuses on the concept of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The issue of land tenure in Kenya can be traced back to the pre-colonial period, when Arab invaders disenfranchised indigenous landowners and established their land-rights within the law. Today, absentee landlords, often belonging to prominent political families, own most of the prime land. A report of the Ministry of Lands published in 2009 explains that they own almost 77’7000 hectares of land, leaving almost 130’000 people as squatters. Hence, to the already existing intra-coastal division over land came an increasing tension between coastal people and people with origins in other parts of the country which contributed to a narrative of coastal dispossession and discrimination against Muslims. ">land tenure</a>, which affects both Muslims and Christians<sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>. Until today, inequalities in land distribution are a massive problem in Kenya, especially in the coastal areas, where vast parts of the prime land is owned by absentee landlords from prominent political families, leaving almost 130’000 people as squatters. Muslim communities and especially religious or political leaders have often used the consequences of coastal dispossession to stress the discrimination of Muslims in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Indeed, a 2013 published Final Report of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya laments the under-development of Muslim-inhabited communities, their underrepresentation in national politics, educational shortcomings and employment-related disadvantages. The main issue for Muslims, however, is the access to national Identity Cards. Kenyan Muslims are often exposed to vetting and harassment when applying for them. Yet, in Kenya, IDs are imperative when registering as a voter, receiving governmental services, enjoying the right of free movement, possessing property, or applying for universities. Furthermore, inhabitants of the northeastern provinces in particular are unproportionally checked at police controls, where the possession of an ID is mandatory<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Hassan Mwakimako confirms that Muslims and particularly Somali are oftentimes targeted by the police based on cultural profiling, a practice which focuses on stereotypes. “There have been attempts to use the law to profile Muslims and sometimes even undermine their rights”, says Mwakimako. <br>
                Contributing to this issue is the ethnic deployment of high-ranking police officers across the country. This strategy is mostly applied during periods of unrest, including the aftermath of terror attacks, or in times of elections. “Officers aligned to the incumbent or the regime in power are deployed mostly in areas dominated by ethnic communities that are perceived to be opposed to the presidency or that regime”, Stars-journalist Ramadhan Rajab explains. According to Hassan Abdille from Muslims for Human Rights (MUHURI) this strategy is also implemented in the coast region, a traditional opposition stronghold: “During the elections we had only two communities deployed here from the police. The president’s family and the deputy president’s tribe. All the police heads were coming from those communities.”</p>

              <p>The historically tense relationship between Muslims and the state has continued to deteriorate following an increasing number of terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations in Muslim-majority regions. As a frontline state in the global war on terror, Kenya has beared the greatest brunt of terrorism in the region. Terrorist attacks in Kenya increased dramatically in October 2011, after Kenya deployed its military to Somalia on its northeastern borders in an attempt to weaken Al-Shabaab and hinder its capacity to launch attacks in Kenya<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>. Since then, there have been multiple devastating attacks in Nairobi as well as in the coastal and northeastern regions in Kenya. Among the most deadly were the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Saturday, 21. September 2013, Nairobi: Four gunmen launched an attack on the Westgate Shopping Mall, a luxury shopping Mall in Nairobi’s Westland district. During the attack at least 67 people were killed and 175 were wounded. The four assassins were shot in the Mall as well. In the aftermath of the attack the Mall was being looted, even by Kenyan soldiers sent in to rescue people and kill the perpetrators. Al-Shabaab quickly claimed responsibility for the attack stating it was retribution for Kenya’s military involvement in Somalia.">Westgate Mall Attack </a> in September 2013, the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Saturday, 5.

At around the same time the village Gamba in Tana River County was attacked too and the militants tried to free alleged Al-Shabaab members held in custody in the local police station. During these two attacks 29 people got killed by the perpetrators. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility stating it was retribution for the stealing of land from Muslim communities.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility stating it was retribution for Kenya’s military involvement in Somalia and that it was carried out at the college because the University was a Christian colony on Muslim lands. ">attack on the Garissa University College</a> in April 2015 in which 148 students were held hostage and killed<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>. There were also attacks on the Kenyan Defense Forces deployed in Somalia, as occurred on January 2016, when Al-Shabaab allegedly killed over 100 KDF (Kenya Defense Forces) soldiers in the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="Friday, 15. January 2016, El Adde: After an explosion caused by a suicide bomber at the gate of the Kenyan Military Base in El Adde Somalia more than 150 Al-Shabaab militants attacked the base holding around 200 Kenyan soldiers. Al-Shabaab claimed to have killed more than 100 of those soldiers and capture twelve, including the commanding officer. It is estimated though that the number of casualties is even higher. But since this would mean the biggest defeat for the Kenyan Military since Kenyan independence, the government tried to cover up the real extent of the attack. Therefore, the real number of victims remains unclear.">Battle of El Adde</a><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>The frequency and magnitude of the attacks have exposed Kenya’s vulnerability and weak defense capacity. With key industries such as tourism stalling, Kenyans are calling for greater security measures across the country<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>. In the face of such a challenge, the Kenyan government has adopted security measures to contain the threat of terrorism, which have been in part funded with financial aid from countries like the US, the UK and Denmark. Since Kenya is considered a regional anchor state in the Horn of Africa and a strategic ally to the West’s counterterrorism efforts in the war on terror, these Western countries also provide Kenya with legal advice and training in counterterrorism operations<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>With funding provided by the counterterrorism initiatives, the Kenyan government has established two major terror-fighting organizations in the last decade: the Anti-terrorism Police Unit (ATPU) and the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC). The ATPU is the main Kenya Police unit responsible for responding to and investigating terrorist activity, while the National Counterterrorism Centre coordinates all government counterterrorism efforts<sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>In addition to these organizations, the Kenyan state has also taken legal measures to fight terrorism within its borders. In 2012, a new bill called the Prevention of Terrorism Act was passed in an attempt to readdress terrorist security threats<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>. The Prevention of Terrorism Act remains the main legal framework through which counter-terrorism measures can be affected in the country, although several amendments were ratified following criticisms by members of the Muslim community and several human rights groups.</p>

              <p>Court judgements against suspected terrorists, however, are rare. It seems to be too difficult to gather enough evidence-based information and to find witnesses willing to testify in court<sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>. Instead, anti-terrorism security forces like the ATPU have used the fight against terrorism as an excuse for the excessive use of force as happened to Abubakar Shariff, a prominent and controversial Islamic cleric who had faced several terrorism charges in court, but could never be convicted. He was finally killed leaving a courtroom<sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>. In addition to this, critics are concerned that due to <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Prevention of Terrorism Act, for example, criminalizes all activities that “create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public”, “result in serious damage to property”, or that “prejudice national security of public safety”, without further clarification. The Kenyan legislation also loosely defines “terrorism” as any activity carried out with the intent of “intimidating or causing fear amongst members of the public or a section of the public,” “intimidating or compelling the Government or international organization to do, or refrain from any act,” or “destabilizing the religious, political, constitutional, economic or social institutions of a country, or an international organization.” ">overly vague definitions of terrorism</a>, police forces could potentially expand their power against political opponents, civil society, religious and ethnic groups, minorities, or any other vulnerable group<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>A closer look at our data indicates that human rights violations by the police increase especially when the threat of terrorism in Kenya is high. Comparing the number of human rights violations recorded in our database with the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The number of terror attacks is reported by the Global Terrorism Database. The Global Terrorism Database is an open-source project started at the University of Maryland including data for over 170’000 terror incidents all over the world from 1970 up until 2016. It contains information on date, location, the weapons used, type of target, number of casualties and perpetrator. The information is gathered from open media sources and only added if the source is deemed credible and thus making it currently the most comprehensive unclassified database on terrorist events in the world. ">number of terror attacks</a> that happened in Kenya per month, we see a strikingly similar trend. Contrasting the peaks in the trend lines, it is interesting to see that the peaks occur more or less at the same time. However, the peaks in the count of recorded human rights violations become larger over time, while the peaks in the number of terror incidents stay relatively stable. This might indicate that the police has indeed been abusing anti-terror laws more frequently in the recent years. </p>

              <p>It is important to note that an increase in human rights violations could also be attributed to the fact that most reports used to collect data date from 2015 and 2016 and therefore may cause an overrepresentation of more recent cases. What is more, comparing the peaks it could be argued that counter-terrorism operations sometimes are sheer reactions to attacks, rather than carefully planned operations against terror-suspects. This impression is shared by Hussein Khalid: “The police is reacting to terror attacks in knee-jerk operations that should show the public that they are actually doing something against the threat of terrorism. However, there is no system in place in these operations.”</p>

              <p>Khalid further claims that the police are likely to have used major terror incidents as a cover up for other actions. “Haki Africa was shut down after the Garissa University attack. Moreover, after the Westgate incident, the government opened up a concentration camp of some sort where people of Somali origin were put for days”, he says, referring to <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="At the beginning of April 2014, the Kenyan government launched a massive crackdown on terror, known as the “Operation Usalama Watch”. According to Kenyan officials, the operation is aimed at detecting illegal immigrants, arresting and prosecuting people suspected of engaging in terrorism and identifying herds of radicalization and lawlessness. The government introduced Usalama Watch after several terrorists happened at the beginning of 2014 in Nairobi and Mombasa. Amnesty International and other human rights organisation claim that the operation led to several human rights violations in the name of national security and is disproportionately focused on the Somali community.

This operation was carried out in spring 2014 and lead to the arbitrary arrest, relocation, harassment and expulsion of hundreds of Somali immigrants locating in Nairobi’s Eastleigh district<sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>According to Hassan Mwakimako, the introduction of the anti-terror bills has led to an increase of violence against Muslims in Kenya and to a suppression of their rights. “The war on terror has led to arbitrary arrests and disrespect to the Muslim traditions. Policemen were sent to several Mosques and distracted prayers or even detained clerics who they said to be radicalizing members of their community.”</p>

              <p>Although some of the Muslim victims targeted by the police were either proven or suspected terrorists, human rights groups have found that security forces appear to indiscriminately target Kenyan and Somali Muslims, regardless of their age or affiliation to terrorist groups. “Muslim communities in Kenya are considered to be suspect communities”, says Hassan Abdille. “Muslims are specifically targeted by the police and go through a lot of harassment. This is why they are feeling marginalized, oppressed and victimized.”</p>

              <p>A Human Rights Watch<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> report published in 2014 revealed that a police raid intended to capture Islamic extremists unfairly targeted innocent civilians. Professor Mwakimako confirms these findings and sheds further light on the situation: “In the event of any terrorist attacks, usually the reaction of the police is to arbitrarily arrest people, to arbitrarily get into people’s houses and in many cases to destroy people’s properties. Muslims that are within the vicinity of where the terrorist attack has happened are most likely going to suffer”, he says. “Even if these people live very far away from the locations of the terrorist attacks, police will go after them and accuse them of involvement in the attacks."</p>

              <p>Hussein Khalid complains that as soon as the police considers someone as a terror suspect, they are as good as guilty. “Once you are declared a suspect, you lose all your rights and the police can do whatever they want. As a terror suspect, you are guilty until proven innocent.“ He also claims that this problem has begun to spill over to civil society and has now even been used to get rid of business rivals. “We have had incidents where people have fights on different issues and will then report their opponent as being involved in terror, because they know that once you are tagged with that, the police will do anything.”</p>

              <p>Even though the ATPU is specialized in carrying out counter-terrorism operations, it is by far not the only unit involved in fighting terrorism. The data analysed for this article reveals the presence of many other security forces, namely units of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The National Police Service of Kenya is incorporated into the Ministry of Interior of Coordination of National Government and consists of the Kenya Police Service (KPS), the Administration Police Service (APS) and the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI). All of them are governed by the Inspector-General of Police but have different Deputy Inspector-Generals. Both the KPS and the APS are responsible for assisting the public, maintaining law and order, protecting life and property. The APS has some additional tasks like border control and security. For historic reasons, they have co-existed under different command structures until the implementation of a new constitution and the National Police Service Act in 2011. The DCI  is responsible for detecting and investigating serious crimes but they also provide criminal intelligence. Accordingly, the ATPU belongs to the DCI. In addition to this, the Kenya Police Reserve exists mainly in rural areas to assist the police units. Moreover, there are various militia, vigilante groups, gangs and private security firms. ">the National Police Service</a> like the General Service Unit (GSU) and forces merely described as ‘Police’ as well as units belonging to the Administration Police, such as the Rapid Deployment Unit (RDU) and the Border Patrol Unit (BPU). In addition to this, the Kenya Police Reserve (KPR), the National Intelligence Service (NIS), the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and the Kenya Defense Forces (KDF) are reportedly active in counter-terrorism operations<sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Whereas the multi-agency strategy might be a reasonable approach from a security perspective – especially since <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The police-public ratio refers to the number of police officers by head of population. According to the World Internal Security & Police Report from 2016, Kenya’s police force is quite small, with only 99 officers per 100’000 civilians. The average of all countries analysed by the report lies at 347 officers per 100’000 civilians. The private security industry in Kenya is also quite small with only 136 private security employees per 100,000 people by an Index average of 330. However, according to our interviewees the number of private agencies could be much higher, as the regulation of the security sector was established only recently, with the signature of the Private Security Industry Regulation Bill in 2016.  ">the police-public ratio</a> in Kenya is low<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup> – it proves disastrous for civil society and human rights organizations seeking to follow up on claims of excessive use of force. Hassan Abdille stated during an interview that his team was initially “completely confused” by the presence of the many agencies. He believes that the multi-agency approach is a means to distract from the actions of the ATPU, which has been exposed to and whose work has been criticized heavily by the public.  “If someone from the KWS kills an individual, people will think that this person must have been suspected of crimes like poaching”, explains Hassan Abdille, since poaching is a severe crime in Kenya and can be punished with heavy fines or life sentences. As reported by various newspapers, Kenya’s government is even considering the introduction of death penalties for poachers<sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, it is is widely stated that various security forces use the counter-terrorism context as a cover-up strategy. An Al-Jazeera documentary on this issue stated that victims of police violence are often called “terrorists” as a way to ward off questions posed regarding excessive use of force. Philip Alston, former United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, contends that it is a standard strategy for the police to create shootout scenarios at crime scenes, even when the persons killed were unarmed<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>. This is contributing to the high number of agencies involved in “counter-terrorism operations”.</p>

              <p>Most importantly, the multi-agency approach of the Kenyan security services hinders the efforts of human rights organizations to follow up on citizens’ complaints of excessive use of force by the police. Both witnesses and victims are sometimes unable to recognize the security forces involved because they often do not show a form of identity such as a badge. To make matters worse, some of the security forces wear similar camouflage uniforms and drive unmarked vehicles<sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup>. Since the jurisdiction of the security forces also remains unclear, it is usually difficult to identify the respective forces.</p>

              <p>Overall, the data we analyzed indicates that the ATPU, the KDF, and the regular police are the three main players in counter-terrorism operations. These three units were involved in almost 70 percent of all cases, which could be due to the circumstance that the KDF, the ATPU and the Police are the only forces operating in all parts of the country.</p>

              <p>The regional distribution of the cases shows that the KDF is mostly involved in the coastal and northeastern part of Kenya. The northeastern cities of Mandera, Wajir and Garissa are described as “violent extremism hotspots”<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup> due to their proximity to the porous border with Somalia. Consequently these cities historically have had a high military presence and a particularly low police-to-public ratio.</p>

              <p>The domestic deployment of the KDF, which is predominant in those cities, is only allowed in situations of unrest or instability to restore peace as well as in cases of emergency or disaster in order to assist other authorities. Both actions have to first be approved by the National Assembly and then issued in the Gazette, the official publication of the government of Kenya. These requirements have not been met so far. It seems that police officers often feel intimidated by military personnel and are unwilling to investigate abuses committed by the KDF. And what’s more,  the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA), an organisation entitled to investigate misconducts by the Police and enhance professionalism within the National Police Service, has no mandate to investigate KDF misconducts either.<sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup></p>

              <p>Concerning cases of extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances of suspected terrorists, the ATPU and the police are each responsible for around 30 to 38 percent of the reported incidences. Rather strikingly, the police is also accused of having been involved in 77 percent of executions of individuals who had no clear links to terrorism. These figures confirm an image of a ‘trigger-happy’ police described by Hassan Mwakimako and Khalid Hussein and  several other observers. When it comes to the enforced disappearances of people who had no clear and confirmed links to terrorism, 45 percent of these cases could be attributed to the the police. However, the KDF and the ATPU are also accused of having participated in 23 percent and 17 percent of enforced disappearances, respectively. This leads to the conclusion that the ATPU and the KDF operate primarily on issues related to terrorism, especially when it comes to killings – although in the case of enforced disappearances, they also target people with unclear links to terrorism-related activities. The picture that can be drawn of the police, on the other hand, confirms the argument that the excessive use of force by Kenya’s security forces is deeply entrenched in the system.</p>

              <p>Indeed, the use of excessive force used by the Kenyan security forces to fight terrorism is highly related to general police violence in Kenya. The Kenyan police is rated to be the third worst police force in 2016 in the <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The World Internal Security and Police Index is a measurement of internal security introduced by the Sharjah Police Department  and the International Police Science Association and developed by the Institute for Economics and Peace in 2016. The Index takes into account the ability of security institutions to maintain security, the effectiveness of those services and the general public’s perception of the police and security. Out of all the 127 countries in the analysis, Kenya ranked third worst when it comes the capacity, process, legitimacy and outcomes of its internal security. The poor ranking of Kenya is explained with the low capacity of the police force due to the small police-public ratio, as well as because of corruption and political terror. "><i>World Internal Security & Police Report</i></a>. This ranking was mainly justified by high corruption and excessive use of force as well as low capacity and restricted access to resources<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>. There were complaints that the Kenyan police efforts lack a research-led approach, strategies of intelligence gathering and careful analysis and that the slow adoption of information technologies hinder information sharing between the units. Accordingly, trust in the police is low. One in every three Kenyans claims to have experienced some sort of police misconduct or abuse<sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>Hussein Khalid cites a popular phrase claiming that “if one was to be given a choice to find themselves in a dark alley with either the police or a robber, Kenyans say that they rather have the robber than the police officer.” Likewise an IMLU-report states that there are more chances in Kenya to be killed by a police officer than by any other person. Furthermore, the police department is said to be the corruptest department in the government<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup>.</p>

              <p>According to Ramadhan Rajab, journalist from the Nairobi based news agency The Star, excessive use of force is not only a consequence of poor policing strategies, but can be traced back to colonial times. “It seems as if the Kenyan police has not dropped the colonial mindset of policing”, he says. “The police officers think they can only enforce the law through violence.” Philip Alston confirmed in a 2009 report<sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup> that violence is deeply entrenched in the Kenyan police sector. Alston concluded that “police in Kenya frequently execute individuals and that the climate of impunity prevails. Most troubling is the existence of police death squads operating on the orders of senior police officials and charged with eliminating suspected leaders and members of criminal organizations.”</p>

              <p>Partly as a reaction to Alston’s report but mostly triggered by increasing criticism within Kenya, there have been constitutional changes of the police system, including staff turnover, the installation of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Office of Director for Public Prosecutions is an independent prosecution authority mandated  by the Constitution to prosecute all criminal cases in the country. The authority’s core tasks include among other the prosecution of those charged by the police and other investigative agencies with criminal offences while upholding, protecting and promoting human and constitutional rights. Furthermore, the office is supposed to monitor the training and appointment of Public Prosecutors in Statutory Corporations,  to address complaints raised by members of the public, watchdog bodies and other institution and to address parliamentary questions relating to administration of criminal justice. ">the Office of the Director for Public Prosecutions </a>, and the establishment of <a href="#whatever" data-toggle="tooltip" class="p-tooltip help" data-placement="top" title="" data-original-title="The Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA) is an organisation entitled to investigate misconducts by the Police and enhance professionalism within the National Police Service. The vision of IPOA is to establish a robust civilian accountability mechanism that promotes public trust and confidence in the National Police Service by conducting impartial and independent investigations of the police sector. IPOA is supposed to investigate any deaths and serious injuries caused by police action to prevent impunity and enhance accountability. IPOA is allowed to conduct inspections of police premises, to monitor and review actions by the internal affairs unit of the police and to investigate police operations and the deployment of officers. ">the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA)</a><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>. Complaints from both members of the public and police officers are collected and analysed by the IPOA. Every six months the IPOA is supposed to summarize these reports and inform the public of its activities and provide recommendations for improvement of the functioning of the National Police Service.</p>

              <p>Although the IPOA has been operating since 2012, police violence is still prevalent. According to Ramadhan Rajab, changes brought about by the reforms are not yet sustainable. “Even though the young police officers might be trained in modern ways of policing – without the use of excessive violence – when they come to the field, they get in contact with the older senior police officers who believe in violence as the ultima ratio”, he says.</p>

              <p>For Ramadhan Rajab, the issue of police violence is an issue of impunity. “It’s not like the officers are legally immune”, the journalist says. “But the problem is that external oversight authorities like the IPOA rely on police to gather information and evidence in order to nail officers who have violated the law.” This is – according to Ramadhan Rajab – highly problematic, because the commanders who are supposed to give evidence to the IPOA to allow them to prosecute criminal officers, do not always report. “So the criminal officers still walk around”, the journalist says. “Sometimes they even commit crimes with the blessing of the top commanders.”</p>

              <p>Hussein Khalid and Hassan Abdille share this view. Khalid complains that none of  the 81 cases his organization had handed over to the IPOA in 2016 has been investigated until 2018. He does not blame IPOA itself that “has done its bits”, but the government which has “intentionally under-resourced them”. A look at the institution’s “End-Term Board Report 2012-2018” confirms this assessment: From the 5085 cases received for investigation 64 were before courts at the time of publication and in only 3 cases had a conviction been made<sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>. Both Abdille and Khalid agree that there is “zero accountability in the police force”. It is “absolutely terrible”, Abdille emphasizes.</p>
